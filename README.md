# Expense Tracker

This is a demo project for an Expense Tracker built using React. As I embark on my journey to learn React, I decided to create this project to practice and showcase my progress.

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **JavaScript**: The programming language used to write the application logic.
- **HTML**: The markup language for creating the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: The styling language for enhancing the visual appearance of the application.
